What is an Episode?

An episode in RL is defined as:

Initialization: The environment is set to an initial state.

Interactions: The agent takes actions based on its current policy (often randomly at the beginning),
                 receives rewards, and transitions through states.

Termination: The episode ends when certain conditions are met, like reaching a predefined number of steps,
             or when the environment reaches a "done" state (e.g., the agent has successfully optimized the placement of ads 
             or reached a maximum number of steps).

What is a Reward?
The reward in RL is a numerical value that the agent receives after taking an action in a given state.
It measures the quality of the agent's action and helps guide its learning process.

For ad placement, a reward could be designed based on:

User engagement: For example, clicks, conversions, or time spent on the page.
Revenue: If the model is designed to optimize for ad revenue, the reward could be the earnings from the ad placement.
User satisfaction: The reward could be based on how well the ad matches user preferences.
